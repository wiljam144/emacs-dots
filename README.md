# WILJAM144 EMACS CONFIG

## Introduction

> It is a story as old as time. A shell-exploring devotee of Vim,
> clinging to modal editing, dwells into a dark place,
> where he falls to the dark curse, forever changing his $EDITOR.
> This is his config.

## Philosophy

This configuration is built on a two core principles:

1. **Humour**: If your editor & your PERSONAL configuration, can't make you laugh, what's the point?
  Since there is not anything more funny than a joke you left for your future self a month ago.
2. **Efficiency**: If it doesn't save me time, it's out.

## Features

Why are you looking at features of someones config?

- **Startup Silence**: No GNU propaganda, no startup screen, just the editor.
- **Trailing Whitespace**: Removed before save. We don't tolerate criminal behaviour.
- **Unicode Love**: Always UTF-8, always.
- **Scrolling**: Smooth and predictable, unlike life.

## Humour

This config doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it take seriously its user.

## Installation
